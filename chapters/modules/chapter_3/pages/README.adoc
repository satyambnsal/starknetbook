= Starknet Book

Welcome to the StarkNet and Cairo Developer's Guide! This book is designed to provide a comprehensive guide for students learning about Cairo and StarkNet. It covers various aspects of development, from getting started with pre-created smart contracts to understanding the architecture of Cairo and StarkNet.

This repo redirects to the Starknet Book front-end (built with Antora) at https://book.starknet.io[book.starknet.io]. *This repo is only for the Starknet Book's source code (text or actual code)*.

Do you want to...
* *read or study* the Starknet Book? Please go to *book.starknet.io*; it is more readable. 
* *contribute* to the Starknet Book (yes, please!)? This is the right place. Go to the contributing section in this README.

This Book contains material for Cairo 1.x versions. If you are looking for content related to the Cairo 0.x versions, please refer to the link:https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/tree/cairo-0[cairo-0 branch].

|Chapter | Goal
|1: Getting Started | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to deploy and interact with a pre-created smart contract using the CLI.
|2: Smart Contracts in Cairo | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to write a Cairo 1.0 smart contract.
|3: Tooling | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to set up a proper development environment (Scarb, Protostar, etc.) and do complex deployments to StarkNet with starknet.js SDK.
|4: Testing | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to manually test in a local environment (Devnet), write unit tests, and integration tests.
|5: Frontend | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to read data from StarkNet, retrieve events, craft transactions, and send them to the network using React and starknet.js.
|6: Running a Node | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to run a StarkNet node and an indexer.
|7: Account Abstraction | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand the interface of a user account, how to create their own user account, and plug it into a browser extension.
|8: StarkNet's Architecture | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand Startknet's architecture, the transaction lifecycle, fees calculation, Prover and verifier interaction, recursion.
|9: Cairo's Architecture | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand how the Cairo virtual machine works, non-deterministic memory model, Sierra's opcode, and the compiler.
|10: STARKs | This should provide the student a conceptual primer so they are able to tie the conceptual and practical aspects of the book together.

== Project Build Process
This documentation site is built using Antora. The Antora documentation site is located at https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora].

The Antora playbook is located within the `antora-playbook.yml` file.

In order to build the documentation site, you will need to install Node.js and npm. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install Antora and the Antora command line interface (CLI) using npm:

`npm install`

The static files for the Antora site can be generated using the following commands:

1. `cd` into the UI directory and run `gulp pack` to generate a zip of the theme files for the UI.
2. Navigate to the root directory and run `antora antora-playbook.yml` to generate the static
files for the documentation site within the `public_html` directory.
