:navtitle: Introduction

== Welcome

Welcome to the Starknet Book!

The Starknet Book is a curriculum created to teach the Cairo programming language and Starknet development. It is divided by Chapters and built by the Starknet community (you!). Finish the resume and you will conquer the Ethereum world.

|===
|Chapter | Goal
|1: Getting Started | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to deploy and interact with a pre-created smart contract using the CLI.
|2: Cairo 1.0 | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to write a Cairo 1.0 smart contract.
|3: Tooling | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to set up a proper development environment (Scarb, Protostar, etc.) and do complex deployments to Starknet with starknet.js SDK.
|4: Testing | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to manually test in a local environment (Devnet), write unit tests, and integration tests.
|5: Frontend | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to read data from Starknet, retrieve events, craft transactions, and send them to the network using React and starknet.js.
|6: Running a Node | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to run a Starknet node and an indexer.
|7: Account Abstraction | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand the interface of a user account, how to create their own user account, and plug it into a browser extension.
|8: Starknet's Architecture | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand Startknet's architecture, the transaction lifecycle, fees calculation, Prover and verifier interaction, recursion.
|9: Cairo's Architecture | At the end of the chapter, a reader should be able to understand how the Cairo virtual machine works, non-deterministic memory model, Sierra's opcode, and the compiler.
|10: STARKs | This should provide the student a conceptual primer so they are able to tie the conceptual and practical aspects of the book together.

== Contributing

The Starknet Book can be improved and will evolve as Starknet matures.
Together we are setting up the Starknet Book, so there are several sections within the Chapters that require community input. Your contributions are welcome and needed!
Go to the section https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing].
Here are things you can do to help:

* In most sections there is a message for builders who want to collaborate with content.
* Empty section in a Chapter? Go for it!
* Do you think the Starknet Book needs an additional section? Propose it.
* Can a section be improved? Feel free to modify it.
* Do you want to add an alternative programming language for the examples? Yes please.
* Correct the bugs if you find any.
* Please add an explanation in the exercise comments if you feel they need them.
* Add exercises that show your favorite feature of Cairo.
