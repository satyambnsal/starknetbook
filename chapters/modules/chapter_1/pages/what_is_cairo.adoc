= What is Cairo?

Cairo is a Turing complete programming language for creating STARK-provable programs for general computation. Cairo is the native smart contract language for Starknet, a permissionless Validity-Rollup.

Cairo 1.0 is the upgraded Rust-inspired version of Cairo, allowing developers to write Starknet smart contracts in a safe and convenient manner.
