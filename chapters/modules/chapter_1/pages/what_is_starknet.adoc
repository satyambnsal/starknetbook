= What is Starknet?

== Introduction

Starknet is a permissionless Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve scale for its computation - without compromising Ethereum's composability and security, thanks to Starknet's reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system - STARK.
