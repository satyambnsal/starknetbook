_*Disclaimers: At the time of writing this tutorial, Cairo 1.0  is at a very early stage and is prone to errors and bugs. Any suggestions/fixes from the community are most welcome._

To write and deploy Cairo contracts on StarkNet, as of today, you will need to install 2 types of repositories:
* CLI to deploy the contract on StarkNet and interact with it (cairo-lang repo)
* Cairo repository: To compile your Cairo 1 smart contract to sierra

The above repositories require you to have the following minimum prerequisites:
* Python 3.9 (You can download from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/[here]).
* Rust (You can install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[here]).

If you already have Python and Rust installed, make sure to double check your Python version and update Rust to the latest version.

Letâ€™s start with installing the CLI on your system.


== CLI Installation

+++<strong>+++Step 1: Set up your virtual environment +++</strong>+++

We recommend working inside a Python virtual environment, but you can also install the Cairo package directly. To create and enter the virtual environment, type:

[,Bash]
----
#Activate your cairo virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
----

Make sure the venv is activated â€“ you should see (cairo_venv) in the command line prompt. 
Your terminal should look like this:

+++<strong>+++Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies +++</strong>+++

Make sure you can install the following pip packages

ecdsa, fastecdsa, sympy (using pip3 install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy). 
On Ubuntu, for example, you will have to first run:

[,Bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
----

On Mac, you can use brew:

[,Bash]
----
brew install gmp
----

There might be some other libraries which are not direct dependencies but they might be indirect dependencies that you would need to install based on your operating system.


+++<strong>+++Step 3: Install cairo-lang CLI +++</strong>+++

If you had cairo-lang installed previously, uninstall it and install the latest downloaded version.

[,Bash]
----
pip3 uninstall cairo-lang
----

[,Bash]
----
pip3 install cairo-lang-0.11.0.1.zip
----

Once you have installed the cairo lang package and installed it, make sure to test your installation by running the following command:

[,Bash]
----
starknet --version
----

Your final output should look something like this:

If your output is as per the above screenshot, then you are all set to get to the next steps! Letâ€™s go!

NOTE: For M1 and M2 users, if you face any issues while running starknet --version command, 
then you may refer to https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22[this] article to follow alternate steps to install the dependencies in Step 2.

== Cairo 1 Installation

+++<strong>+++Step1: Clone the cairo repository and set it up using the following instructions:+++</strong>+++

[,Bash]
----
# Clone the Cairo compiler to the $HOME directory
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/

#Rename the cairo folder to .cairo in order to keep it hidden
mv cairo .cairo

#Checkout into the working branch and generate the release binaries
cd .cairo/
git checkout 9c190561ce1e8323665857f1a77082925c817b4c
cargo build --all --release

----

+++<strong>+++Step 2: Add Cairo 1.0 executables to your path:+++</strong>+++

Now that we have built the Cairo 1.0 binaries, we need to add them to the PATH environment variable. Add the following in your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[,Bash]
----
#Add the below command to your .bashrc or .zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cairo/target/release:$PATH"
----

After that, open a new shell and check that the following command returns a version number:

[,Bash]
----
cairo-compile --version
----

Your output should look something like this(not necessarily inside the cairo_venv):

Woohoo! Now we have everything we need to compile, deploy and interact with our first Cairo contract!
